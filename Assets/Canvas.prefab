  m_Text: "Steven Paul Jobs (/\u02C8d\u0292\u0252bz/; February 24, 1955 \u2013 October
    5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, marketer, and inventor, who was the cofounder,
    chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc. Through Apple, he is widely recognized as a charismatic
    and design-driven pioneer of the personal computer revolution and for his influential
    career in the computer and consumer electronics fields, transforming \"one industry
    after another, from computers and smartphones to music and movies.\" Jobs cofounded
    and served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of
    the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, when Disney acquired
    Pixar. Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of Xerox PARC's
    mouse-driven graphical user interface, which led to the creation of the Apple
    Lisa and, a year later, the Macintosh. He played a role in introducing the LaserWriter,
    one of the first widely available laser printers, to the market.After a power
    struggle with the board of directors in 1985, Jobs left Apple and founded NeXT,
    a computer platform development company specializing in the higher-education and
    business markets. In 1986, he acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm,
    which was spun off as Pixar. He was credited in Toy Story (1995) as an executive
    producer and characteristically forgiving principal investor of Pixar. He served
    as CEO and majority shareholder until Disney's purchase of Pixar in 2006. In 1996,
    after Apple had failed to deliver its operating system, Copland, Gil Amelio turned
    to NeXT Computer, and the NeXTSTEP platform became the foundation for the Mac
    OS X. Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor, and took control of the company as
    an interim CEO. Jobs brought Apple from near bankruptcy to profitability by 1998.As
    the new CEO of the company, Jobs oversaw the development of the iMac, iTunes,
    iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and on the services side, the company's Apple Retail Stores,
    iTunes Store and the App Store. The success of these products and services provided
    several years of stable financial returns, and propelled Apple to become the world's
    most valuable publicly traded company in 2011. The reinvigoration of the company
    is regarded by many commentators as one of the greatest turnarounds in business
    history.In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreas neuroendocrine tumor. Though
    it was initially treated, he reported a hormone imbalance, underwent a liver transplant
    in 2009, and appeared progressively thinner as his health declined. On medical
    leave for most of 2011, Jobs resigned in August that year, and was elected Chairman
    of the Board. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5,
    2011.Jobs received a number of honors and public recognition for his influence
    in the technology and music industries. He has been referred to as \"legendary\",
    a \"futurist\" and a \"visionary\", and has been described as the \"Father of
    the Digital Revolution,\" a \"master of innovation,\" \"the master evangelist
    of the digital age\" and a \"design perfectionist.\""
